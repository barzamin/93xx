This ZIP Archive contains all of the JED files to enable firmware options in the 93XX series scopes. These burn into 16V8-15 GAL's. Recommended type is Atmel AT16V8BQL-15 or faster GALS. Other brands may work as well. They plug into the OPTION socket on the CPU2 or CPU3 card in the scope. Take care to align the notch with the socket! Also if you are installing all options it is recommended that you use GAL file CLE2EF_A.JED as this enables all the really useful options. You can also use CLEFFFF_A.JED which turns on all the options but bewaresome options (like MATE and standard GPIB) may conflict.

It is also recommended that you update the firmware in the instrument. Latest (and last) are:

Flash based CPU3:
8.2.2

EPROM based CPU3
8.2.1 (although 8.2.2 will work but there is no operational difference).

EPROM based CPU2
7.2.2

See the files section for the firmware updating files and the instructions for updating.
